# Alice

What started as an one-day workshop from [OpenVis Conference: Text Analysis and visualization Methods](https://openvisconf.com/workshops/#text-analysis-and-visualization-methods) sprawled out as a collaboration between Shanfan and [Zdenek](https://github.com/zdenekhynek) to visualize the all-time favorite children's story: Alice In Wonderland.

## Getting Started

There is one optional `npm` package you can use to host this site locally.

Running:

```
npm install
```

Should install the `http-server` node module locally.

Then the local server can be started using:

```
npm start
```

Which simply runs the server in this directory.
